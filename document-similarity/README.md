CoAnSys/document-similarity
=============

## About
CoAnSys/document-similarity is a subproject containing methods to easily find a set of similar documents or compute similarity between pairs of documents.

## Prerequirements
This package depends on [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) from [Cloudera distribution](https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/SUPPORT/CDH+Downloads), version CDH 4.3.0. 
As CDH4 depends on [Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) 2.4.1 so is CoAnSys/importers.
