BSON [bee·sahn], short for Binary JSON, is a binary-encoded serialization of
JSON-like documents. Like JSON, BSON supports the embedding of documents and
arrays with­in other documents and arrays. BSON also contains extensions that
allow representation of data types that are not part of the JSON spec. For
example, BSON has a Date type and a BinData type.

BSON can be compared to binary interchange formats, like Protocol Buffers.
BSON is more "schema-less" than Protocol Buffers, which can give it an
advantage in flexibility but also a slight disadvantage in space efficiency
(BSON has overhead for field names within the serialized data).
